# Jeopardy_hacking
15th guided project from DataQuest.io

This dataset is a collection of questions/answers and other data from the gameshow Jeopardy, and our goal is to determine trends in the questions to hack the show

We looked at how many questions contained the answers in the question,
how many times questions or topics are recycled,
and whether or not the topic recycling correlated more with low-value or high-vlaue questions
